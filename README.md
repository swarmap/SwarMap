# SwarMap

## Description
A hosted map app to help meet fellow Swarmwise activists nearby. Although not in a stable state, this project intends to make it easier for participants of Swarmwise projects like Redecentralize to collaborate physically or online, within a geographical area (in order to solve issues particular to an area).

## Potential Roadmap?

### MVP - v1.0
People can add a pin to the map with minimal contact information and also delete their own pin in the future.

### Feature Suggestions (Make your own too!).
- Colour coded pins based on role within a project. (e.g. Media, Design, Blog, Technical).
- Shaded regions to indicate the areas.
- Special pins for *geography leaders*.
- Event highlighting.

## Contributing
Just create pull requests and have fun - there's nobody depending on this project yet :)
