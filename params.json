Although not in a stable state, this project intends to make it easier for participants of Swarmwise projects like Redecentralize to collaborate physically or online, within a geographical area (in order to solve issues particular to an area).\r\n\r\n## Potential Roadmap?\r\n\r\n### MVP - v1.0\r\nPeople can add a pin to the map with minimal contact information and also delete their own pin in the future.\r\n\r\n### Feature Suggestions (Make your own too!).\r\n- Colour coded pins based on role within a project. (e.g. Media, Design, Blog, Technical).\r\n- Shaded regions to indicate the areas.\r\n- Special pins for *geography leaders*.\r\n- Event highlighting.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nJust create pull requests and have fun - there's nobody depending on this project yet :)\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Olivia Mackintosh\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
